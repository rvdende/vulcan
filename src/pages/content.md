# CLIENT's EXPERIENCES

## Peach Payments

Peach Payments is the trusted African payment gateway with easy ecommerce integrations and personalised multi-channel support. Vulcan Labs’s team of expert software & QA engineers works fully integrated with Peach Payment’s internal team developing and evolving their payment platforms on the AWS Cloud platform.

### The Challenge

- Re-engineering Legacy Stacks on the AWS Cloud platform

Peach Payments’s vision is to deliver delightful experiences for merchants and users, and be the payments partner of choice on the African continent. Providing robust and modern solutions that adapt to real-time demands, combined with a fast onboarding process for merchants, has seen them become one of the fastest growing payment gateways in South Africa.

With more than 10 years of experience and an ever growing number of ecommerce platform integrations (WooCommerce, Shopify, Wix just to name a few), Peach is the leading the charge and gaining a massive following. Their customer-first approach helps them develop solutions that talk to current customer and market demands and create value. But doing so calls for a strong team of senior engineers to support their digital environment and products. That’s why they reached out to Vulcan Labs to help lead the re-engineering of their stack on the AWS Cloud platform.

# The Solution

- Providing Highly Skilled and Experienced Engineers
Peach didn’t just want technical expertise – they required innovative and creative developers that could meet their high-quality standards and help them take their web platform to the next level.

Through our Dedicated Team and Specialist IT Resourcing services, we provide Peach with expert skillsets to support its operations. We’ve been boosting their in-house team with frontend (React, TypeScript), backend (AWS API Gateway, Lambda), database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift) and QA engineers, helping Peach to meet its growth targets, living up to the highest standards in the industry.
